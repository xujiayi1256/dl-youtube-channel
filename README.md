### Download videos from a YouTube channel with Python

YouTube Data API key is **required**, get yours [HERE](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) with your Google account.

Video downloading feature uses [youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/).

<u>Known Issue:</u> YouTube Data API seems not returning all videos from a channel, better way to get video links to be found.
